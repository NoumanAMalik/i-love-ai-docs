##  A∗ search
- A* Search algorithm is one of the best and popular technique used in path-finding and graph traversals
- Informally speaking, A* Search algorithms, unlike other traversal techniques, it has “brains”. What it means is that it is really a smart algorithm which separates it from the other conventional algorithms.

The most common informed search algorithm is A
∗
search (pronounced “A-star search”), a A
∗
search
best-first search that uses the evaluation function
f(n) = g(n) +h(n)
where g(n) is the path cost from the initial state to node n, and h(n) is the estimated cost of
the shortest path from n to a goal state, so we have

f(n) = estimated cost of the best path that continues from n to a goal.
