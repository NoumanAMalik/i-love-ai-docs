# Summary: Forward Chaining in First-Order Logic

## 9.3 Forward Chaining

In Section 7.5, a forward-chaining algorithm for propositional definite clauses was introduced. Here, the concept is extended to cover first-order definite clauses. Definite clauses in the form Antecedent ⇒ Consequent are used to represent real-world systems.

### 9.3.1 First-order definite clauses

First-order definite clauses are disjunctions of literals, where exactly one is positive. They can be atomic or implication statements with a conjunction in the antecedent and a single positive literal in the consequent. Quantifiers are implicit, and a typical first-order definite clause looks like `King(x)∧Greedy(x) ⇒ Evil(x)`.

### 9.3.2 Representing a problem using definite clauses

A problem involving an American selling weapons to a hostile nation is represented using first-order definite clauses. Rules and facts are formulated, such as the crime-related rules `American(x)∧Weapon(y)∧Sells(x, y, z)∧Hostile(z) ⇒ Criminal(x)`.

### 9.3.3 Forward-chaining algorithm

A simple forward-chaining algorithm is introduced. Starting from known facts, it triggers rules whose premises are satisfied, adding conclusions to known facts. This process repeats until the query is answered or no new facts are added.

## 9.3.4 Efficient Forward Chaining

### Matching rules against known facts

The inner loop of the algorithm involves matching rules against facts, with challenges in matching complex rules efficiently. Despite some NP-hardness in matching, most real-world rules are small, making data complexity polynomial.

### Incremental forward chaining

An incremental forward-chaining algorithm is introduced, where redundant rule matching is avoided by considering only rules relevant to new facts inferred in the previous iteration. This improves efficiency.

### Irrelevant facts

Efficiency is further addressed by considering the relevance of inferences. Techniques such as the Rete algorithm and deductive databases are introduced to optimize forward chaining, ensuring that only relevant conclusions are drawn.
