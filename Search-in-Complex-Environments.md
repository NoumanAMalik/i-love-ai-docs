### 4.1 Search in Non-Deterministic Environments
- Examines the challenges in environments where actions have non-deterministic outcomes.
- Introduces conditional plans and AND-OR search trees to handle non-determinism.
- Discusses the importance of contingency plans to cover all possible outcomes of actions.

### 4.2 Sensorless and Partially Observable Problems
- Addresses problems where the agent's sensors provide no information or partial information.
- Explores belief state space where the agent must consider all possible states it might be in.
- Shows how to construct solutions in belief state space using modified search algorithms.

### 4.3 Online Search Agents and Unknown Environments
- Considers agents that operate by interleaving computation with action, which is essential in dynamic or unknown environments.
- Describes how agents can learn about the environment through their actions.
- Introduces exploration strategies for agents in unknown environments, including online depth-first search and learning real-time A* (LRTA*).

### 4.3 Search with Nondeterministic Actions
- Conditional plans for nondeterministic problems require if-then-else structures.
- AND-OR search trees are used to handle nondeterministic branching due to environmental outcomes.
- A solution for an AND-OR search problem is a subtree covering all contingencies.
- Cyclic solutions may be needed in slippery environments where actions sometimes fail.
- A cyclic plan is considered a solution if it guarantees reaching a goal state despite nondeterminism.

### 4.4 Search in Partially Observable Environments
- Sensorless problems are tackled by exploring belief states rather than physical states.
- Belief-state space is fully observable to the agent, even if the physical environment is not.
- Actions in belief-state space are either the union or intersection of actions in all possible physical states.
- PERCEPT functions determine the percept received in a given state.
- Transition models for belief states occur in three stages: prediction, possible percepts, and update.
- Conditional plans that consider all possible percepts are derived using the AND-OR search algorithm adapted for belief states.
- Partially observable environments necessitate maintaining a belief state and adapting to new percepts.
- An agent must execute conditional plans and update its belief state based on percepts and actions.
- State estimation is critical in complex environments to maintain an accurate belief state.
- Discusses the opportunities for learning in online search, including learning a map of the environment and updating cost estimates.
- Suggests that agents can improve their future problem-solving abilities by using incremental search strategies.

### 4.5 Online Search Agents and Unknown Environments
- Online search agents interleave computation with action in dynamic environments.
- The online search process involves exploration, sensing, and planning based on current knowledge.
- Online algorithms must adapt to dead ends and potentially irreversible actions.
- Online search agents build a map of the environment through exploration and update it with each action.
- Depth-first and other local search strategies can be adapted for online search.
- Hill climbing with memory (LRTA*) can be effective for online search in unknown environments.
- Random walks guarantee eventual success in finite, safely explorable environments but may be inefficient.
- Online search agents learn from their environment and improve heuristic estimates through experience.
- Agents can utilize incremental search strategies to improve future problem solving.

### Key Ideas
- Non-determinism and partial observability introduce significant complexities to the search problem.
- Online search strategies enable agents to deal with unknown and changing environments effectively.
- Learning from experience allows agents to refine their strategies and improve their performance over time.
