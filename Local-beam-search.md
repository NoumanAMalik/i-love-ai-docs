# Local Beam Search

Local Beam Search is a search algorithm that expands upon the idea of hill climbing by simultaneously exploring multiple paths or states rather than a single current state. This approach is designed to reduce the probability of getting stuck in local optima, a common problem with basic hill climbing algorithms. Local Beam Search maintains a fixed number of states (the "beam width") and at each iteration, generates all successors of these states, then selects the best ones to continue the search.

## Overview

Unlike traditional hill climbing that maintains a single current state and explores its neighbors, Local Beam Search keeps track of `k` states at once, where `k` is the beam width. This allows the algorithm to explore a broader range of the search space. The key idea is to focus the search on the most promising areas by only considering a fixed number of the best candidates at each step.

## How It Works

Local Beam Search operates by initializing `k` randomly selected states. It then iterates through the following steps:

1. **Generate Successors**: For each of the `k` states, generate all possible successors.
2. **Select Best**: From all the successors, select the `k` best ones based on a specified heuristic or fitness function.
3. **Check for Goal**: Determine if any of the `k` selected states is a goal state. If so, terminate the search.
4. **Repeat**: Continue this process until the goal is found or no improvement is seen.

## Properties

- **Parallel Exploration**: Explores multiple paths in parallel, making it less likely to get trapped in local maxima compared to simple hill climbing.
- **Fixed Memory Requirement**: Only needs to keep track of `k` states at any given time, making memory requirements predictable.
- **Flexibility**: The beam width `k` offers a tunable parameter that can balance between exploration and exploitation.

## Advantages

- **Reduced Risk of Local Optima**: By maintaining multiple candidate solutions, the algorithm is less prone to getting stuck in local optima.
- **Scalability**: Suitable for large search spaces due to its parallel exploration nature and fixed memory usage.
- **Customizability**: The beam width `k` can be adjusted to suit the specific needs of the problem or computational constraints.

## Limitations

- **No Guarantee of Optimality**: The algorithm does not guarantee finding the optimal solution, as it may overlook potential paths outside the current beam.
- **Stagnation**: The search can still stagnate if all `k` states converge to a non-optimal region of the search space.
- **Selection of `k`**: Determining the optimal beam width can be challenging and may require domain knowledge or experimentation.

## Applications

Local Beam Search is used in various fields and applications, including:

- **Optimization Problems**: Finding optimal or near-optimal solutions in large or complex search spaces.
- **Machine Learning**: Feature selection, neural network training, and other areas where exploring multiple hypotheses in parallel is beneficial.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Planning, scheduling, and problem-solving in situations where multiple potential solutions should be considered.

## Conclusion

Local Beam Search is a powerful algorithm that enhances the capabilities of hill climbing by exploring multiple paths simultaneously. This approach helps mitigate the risk of getting stuck in local optima, making it a useful tool for tackling complex optimization and search problems. However, like all search algorithms, it has its limitations and requires careful tuning and consideration of the problem domain to achieve the best results.
